# Snowflake SVG Generator

I built this project over the holiday to generate random snowflake svg's for a friend who was planning to have sheets of them lasercut.

## Examples

## UI

User interface is pretty non-existent, see script `if __name__ == '__main__'` for basic usage example and how to override the default parameters.
